`the pwd` command (print working directory) writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output.

`The cd` (“change directory”) command is used to change the current working directory in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is one of the most basic and frequently used commands when working on the Linux terminal

If you type `cd .`, you will change into the current directory or, in other words, the command will do nothing.

Suppose you are currently in the /usr/local/share directory. To switch to the /usr/local directory (one level up from the current directory), you would type: `$ cd ../`

`cd -` followed by a dash will bring you to the recent directory you were in.
